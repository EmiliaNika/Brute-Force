# Brute Force ssh , usernames ,password
# Python script to read these files and attempt to log in with each combination of username and password
# With multi-threading, each combination of username and password will be attempted concurrently, making the process faster. However, 
# keep in mind that too many concurrent threads can put a heavy load on the remote server, 
# and some servers might have protection mechanisms in place to block such brute-force attempts.
# You can experiment with the number of threads to find a balance between speed and not overwhelming the server with too many requests.
# Again, I must emphasize that you should only use this tool on systems for which you have explicit permission to access.
# Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and unethical. 
# Always use your programming skills responsibly and ethically.
# This is for Education Purpose guys, Use it Ethically.
